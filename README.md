> This bootcamp is designed to help familiarize you with GitHub Advanced Security's (GHAS) secret scanning feature so that you can better understand how to use it in your own repositories.

## :mega: Prerequisites
To participate in the workshop you need a GitHub account **(ARE THE REST OF THESE PREREQUISITES NEEDED? [Can't we make this repo a public template?])** and need to be invited to the workshop organization [ghas-bootcamp](https://github.com/ghas-bootcamp). If your repository hasn't been automatically created in the workshop organization, either click `Use this template` and create a repository under this organization, or create a new repository and push a copy of the `ghas-bootcamp` repository to an organization with GHAS enabled.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghas-bootcamp/ghas-bootcamp.git
cd ghas-bootcamp
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:{org-or-username}/{repo-name}.git
```
