> This bootcamp is designed to help familiarize you with the GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) secret scanning feature so that you can better understand how to use it in your own repositories.

To participate in the bootcamp you need a GitHub account. You should create a fork of this repository template, hosting it under your personal account and making it public.

## üè´ Exercise

You should complete the following tasks:
- [ ] Enable secret scanning
      1. Understand that secret scanning does not need to be explicitly enabled since this is a public repository, and that the purpose of this step is to learn where the settings are so you can configure secret scanning for internal and private repositories if/when you obtain GHAS licenses.

      3. Click on the "Settings" option toward the top of the page and then scroll down and click on "Code security" on the left-hand side of the page.
      4. Scroll down to the "Secret scanning" section and observe that a button is available for disabling this feature.
